**Introduction:**
A "room rental marketplace" serves as an online platform connecting property owners with individuals seeking accommodations for short or long durations. It facilitates seamless transactions between hosts and guests, providing an ideal solution for both parties. Examples of such platforms in the UK include Rightmove, SpareRoom, OpenRent, and RoomGo.

**Domain Description:**
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive database system tailored for a Room Rental Marketplace. This system will efficiently store and manage various data points integral to the rental ecosystem, including information about property owners, potential tenants, property listings (such as rooms and flats), user details, messages, notifications, and more. The primary goal is to ensure the safe and organized management of data, facilitating secure interactions, transactions, and effective property management within the marketplace platform.
